# Smart Parking Lot Management System

A simple, modular Java application that models and simulates a smart parking lot management system.

This repository contains a lightweight, educational implementation demonstrating common design patterns for parking management: parking strategies, cost computation strategies, ticket generation, display panels, and payment processing.

## Key features

- Multiple parking strategies (nearest, random) to choose the best available spot
- Typed parking spots and vehicles (e.g., COMPACT, LARGE) with allocation rules
- Parking ticket generation and basic cost computation strategy
- Simple payment processors (cash, card) and display panels for entry/exit
- Clean package organization for easy extension and testing

## Project structure

Top-level Java package: `org.splms`

Important packages and responsibilities:

- `coststrategy` - cost computation strategy interfaces and implementations
- `displayPanel` - UI/display panel abstractions for entry, exit and floor displays
- `panels` - simple console panels for entry/exit flows
- `parkingFloor` - representation of a parking floor and its spots
- `parkingStrategy` - algorithms to select the best spot (nearest, random)
- `parkingticket` - ticket generation and ticket model
- `payment` - payment processing interfaces and implementations

Source files are under `src/main/java/org/splms`.

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

Prerequisites:

- Java 8+ (JDK)
- Maven

Build the project (skip tests for a faster build):

```powershell
mvn -DskipTests package
```

Copy runtime dependencies (optional, if you want to run the packaged app with external deps):

```powershell
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=target/dependency
```

Run the main class (uses the compiled classes and any copied dependencies):

```powershell
# If you copied dependencies:
java -cp "target/classes;target/dependency/*" org.splms.Main

# If no external dependencies are required:
java -cp "target/classes" org.splms.Main
```

Note: Replace `org.splms.Main` with your entry point if different.

## How it works (high level)

- `ParkingLot` coordinates floors and handles entry/exit operations.
- When a vehicle arrives, a `ParkingStrategy` implementation selects an available `ParkingSpot`.
- A `ParkingTicket` is generated by `ParkingTicketGenerator` and returned to the user.
- On exit, the ticket is used to compute cost via a `CostComputationStrategy` and a `PaymentProcessor` handles payment.

## Extending the project

To add a new parking strategy:

1. Implement the `ParkingStrategy` interface in `parkingStrategy`.
2. Add wiring where the strategy is chosen (e.g., constructor injection into `ParkingLot` or `ParkingFloor`).

To add a new payment processor or cost strategy, implement the corresponding interface under `payment` or `coststrategy`.

## Tests

There are currently no automated tests in this repository. Recommended next steps:

- Add unit tests for `ParkingStrategy` implementations and `ParkingFloor` allocation logic.
- Add integration tests that simulate entry/exit flows and payment calculations.

## Development notes

- The codebase targets a plain Java + Maven setup and avoids heavy external frameworks to stay focused on architecture patterns.
- Keep classes small and single-responsibility to make testing and extension easier.
